This is a small project I worked on at Tier5. My first Google Chrome extension, This "Notepad" allows you to type small & quick notes. On the phone and need to write something down? Chances are you're already at a browser . Text will be automatically saved every time a key is pressed.

Instruction ( How to install) : 
1. Create a Folder ( Notepad-Extension), then create the files for the extension (Ex:Manifest.json, Popup.html etc.) 
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
3. Click load unpacked-extension & select the project folder for your extension to install it.
4. Then click the notepad icon & write your notes.
